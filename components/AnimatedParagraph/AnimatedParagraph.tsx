           &nbsp;your friendly neighborhood frontend developer with a sprinkle of caffeine ☕️ and a dash of open-source passion ✨. I'm all about creating user-friendly web interfaces that are not only stunning but also leave a positive mark on the world.
          When the keyboard goes silent, you'll find me out with friends 🤝🏻, diving into the wisdom of expert blogs (and maybe a guilty pleasure meme or two 😄), or just chilling with a good book 📚 and a steaming cup of Moroccan mint tea 🍵.</p>
